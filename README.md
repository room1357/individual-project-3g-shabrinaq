## 4. EXPENSE LIST (ADD, EDIT, & DELETE EXPENSE)
In this expense list, we can see all of our expenses (without the category button). We can also add, edit, and delete them. Data that has been successfully added will automatically appear in the advanced expense list (expense analysis).

# 6. PROFILE
In this profile section, I did not edit my profile photo, but users can edit their account information. Then at the bottom, there is a logout button to exit the application.

## 7. SETTINGS (API)
In the Settings feature, it is used to implement the API in the Dark Mode settings, and in this Settings section there is also an About card for the application. Dark Mode data is stored on the server so that user display preferences can be accessed consistently from various devices. With this approach, Dark Mode settings are not only stored locally, but also integrated with the backend system.
Without the API

## 8. CATEGORYS

## 10. SHARED & DETAIL EXPENSES 
The Shared Expenses feature allows users to add expense calculation data, such as proof of payment, when splitting expenses with friends. This feature automatically displays the amount to be paid by each participant and provides detailed information about the expenses.
